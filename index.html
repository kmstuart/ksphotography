    <h2 id="rcorners1"> About Me </h2>
    <p>I am passionate about art and always have been. I love creating short videos on iMovie, crafting art projects, and painting and drawing in my personal journals. A cheap blue waterproof camera from Costco that my mom bought made a profound impact on my art career. With this camera, I captured hundreds of photos of candid moments of my family and friends as well as the buildings, nature, and people around me. While these photos lacked artistically, they definitely started my love of photography and capturing moments in time to communicate a narrative. 
    During three years of studying art in high school, I concentrated on taking photos of nature and moments in time rather than trying to create an image that is a false reality. Emotionally impacting those who see my work gives me pride and joy in what I create. Candidly capturing a moment in time where the subject does not know someone is watching so you can capture an emotion, is another area I have focused on. Now pursuing a career in photography through my college courses, I push myself out of my comfort zone and photographed people inside of a studio with artificial lighting. I continue to learn and grow by trying different types of photography like sports, architecture, and animal portraits. My goal is to become well-rounded and diverse in my field.</p>
